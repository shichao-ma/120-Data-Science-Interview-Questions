## Communication (5 questions)


#### 1. Explain to me a technical concept related to the role that you’re interviewing for.
#### 2. Introduce me to something you’re passionate about.
#### 3. How would you explain an A/B test to an engineer with no statistics background? A linear regression?
  - AB test is just a fancy name of doing experiments. If you want to understand how certain things, say changing the color of our website, impacts our revenue, then we can just run a series of experiments with different website colors and compare the results with our base case. 
#### 4. How would you explain a confidence interval to an engineer with no statistics background? What does 95% confidence mean?
  - Confidence interval = range estimation = uncertainty of point estimation.
  - say we want to estimate the prob of raining tomorrow. We can give a point estimation: 60%. But how certain am I? To give this information, I can pair with a CI: I'm 95% confident tomorrow's rain prob is between 50% and 70%.
  - 95% means if I do such range prediction enough times, I will be correct in 95% of my predictions (by correct, I mean the true value will fall into the range prediction).
  - If my audience can't understand the frequentist interpretation of CI, then I'm okay if my audience understanding the "wrong" Bayesian interpretation as long as we can move the project forward.

#### 5. How would you explain to a group of senior executives why data is important?
  - Group persuasion problem. Find a middle person who is not very far from me and not very far from the median and win him/ her over.
